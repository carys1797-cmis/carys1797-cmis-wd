					Lists and Links
				</h2>
				<p>
					We created a new folder called "Lists and Links". Within the new subfolder, we created new index.html and main.css files. Then we ordered and unodered lists and links to the index.html file. Finally, we created a link on the main index.html page that leads to the subpage, "Lists and Links".
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Create a new folder called "listsandlinks" in your repository folder.</li>
					<li>Inside listsandlinks create a file called "index.html" and a file called "main.css"</li>
					<li>In index.html create an ordered list of step by step instructions to create a new webpage on the production server.</li>
					<li>Also create an unordered list of 5 or more links to websites with useful webdesign related information.</li>
					<li>In the nav section, create an unordered list of links with a link back to your main index page.</li>
					<li>In your main index.html file in public_html, add an unordered list of links to the nav section with a link to "listsandlinks".</li>
					<li>In your old index.html, add an article with a heading and a paragraph description of this assignment. Also add an unordered list that contains this list of requirements.</li>
					<li>Turn in your work.</li>
